# UI Surface Use Cases

Last updated: March 13, 2026

## Decision model

### Panel
Use `Panel` when users must keep the main page visible while editing related details.

Best for:
- Contextual side-by-side editing tied to a selected row, card, node, or canvas item.
- Repeated quick edits where users open/close the same surface often.
- Workspaces where docking preserves orientation (calendar, builder, structure editors).

Avoid when:
- The task is a short standalone flow (create/confirm/quick settings).
- The form is critical-path on small screens and should own the viewport.

### Popup
Use `Popup` for short, focused, blocking tasks with clear primary actions.

Best for:
- Create/edit flows that do not require constant side-by-side context.
- Confirmation dialogs with meaningful content.
- Utility settings dialogs (for example table column preferences).

### Popover
Use `Popover` for lightweight anchored UI only.

Best for:
- Menus, quick actions, tiny contextual controls.
- Short content that should stay visually attached to the trigger.

Avoid:
- Long forms, multi-step tasks, or heavy explanatory copy.
- Header/footer action bars.

### Full-Screen Popup
Use `FullScreenPopup` when the task should temporarily become the whole experience.

Best for:
- Dense input flows in mobile/public contexts.
- Multi-section forms where side docking harms readability.
- Situations where accidental background interaction is risky.
